# Safe Browsing
*Last updated August 5, 2025*

## Overview

Web browsers are one of the most commonly used apps which makes them prime attack vectors for threat actors to collect your sensitive information and to infect your computer with malware. 
It is increasingly important for you to take extra precautions to avoid becoming a victim. 
A lot of web browsers take steps to help mitigate attacks, but they can't stop everything. 
It is up to you to take the proper security precautions to protect yourself.

## Bottom Line
1) Enable MFA—or 2FA if MFA is not available—for every one of your accounts.
2) Start using a password manager secured behind MFA so that you can consistently use strong and complex passwords.

## Strengthen the security of your accounts

Single-factor authentication with just a password is one of the greatest risks to your account.
Take a moment to imagine an account as a house and a password as a key. If someone gets a hold of the key, they can enter into the house without a second thought.
A key can become compromised in many different ways. It may be left in an unsafe location, it may be given to a trusted individual who then loses it, or it may be fraudulently copied.
This goes to show that a singular key is not enough.

Consider enabling **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** or **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for every one of your accounts if it is available.
2FA requires you to provide two pieces of evidence to verify that your login attempt is legitimate.
Logging into an account with 2FA enabled typically involves a password and a second factor such as a code sent to your phone via SMS or an authenticator app.
This instantly makes logging into your account more secure because an attacker will also need access to your phone in order to log into you account.
MFA is like 2FA but it is even more secure because it may involve a combination of two or more factors such as password, codes, biometrics, and security keys.

Keep in mind that if an attacker gets a hold of your SIM card, you may be vulnerable to an account breach if your MFA methods rely solely on your phone number.
To prevent this, I recommend using an authenticator app like Google Authenticator—available on both Google Play and the Apple App Store.
Setting up a 2FA code for every one of your accounts is a breeze, it can be used across a wide range of online accounts, and it is more secure than SMS-based authentication.

## Use a password manager

Now that you know how to safely set up an account with MFA, you can set up an account with MFA enabled for a password manager so that you will only ever need to remember one password—the one you use to log into the password manager itself.
A password manager acts as a digital vault for your login credentials. 
Whenever you create an account or log into one, your password manager will ask you if you would like to store your credentials for it.
Additionally, whenever you go to log into an account that is saved within your password manager, it will show a popup box to automatically fill in your saved credentials for you.

> Please note: you should never sign into your password manager on an untrusted, public device. If you accidentally stay logged in to your password manager, anyone will be able to access your credentials. This becomes slightly less of a problem if all of your accounts are behind MFA however.

When creating a new account, your password manager will automatically generate a complex password for you to use such as: xhm3gzx5fkg!VAF3thq.
Using a complex and unique password for every one of your accounts will significantly reduce the risk of you password being cracked.
Because your password manager will remember all your complex passwords for you, you do have to worry about making them memorable any more.
In the event of a massive password breech, some password managers will actually notify you to update a password if it detects that the credential has been compromised.

Our IT department uses [1Password](https://1password.com/) as our dedicated password manager.
It allows you to create separate vaults so that the login credentials for shared accounts can be available to whoever you share the vault with.
1Password is a paid service, but the password manager that comes with your web browser of mobile phone will typically work just fine.

> If you are going to use a password manager, make sure you **enable MFA or 2FA**. Don't take the risk of someone being able to steal all of your login information.

## Be aware of phishing attacks and scams

A phishing attack is when a malicious actor attempts to trick you into giving them your login credentials. 
Many phishing attacks attempt to spoof common services like Google, Microsoft, and PayPal all the while creating some sense of urgency to rush you into making a hasty decision.
I have already written two solid articles relating to phishing.
1) I would highly recommend reading this article which links to an interactive quiz and shows real phishing attacks. (https://it.bockwaterheaters.com/#/cybersecurity/phishing)[https://it.bockwaterheaters.com/#/cybersecurity/phishing]  
2) This one goes into detail about the common signs of a phishing attack. (https://it.bockwaterheaters.com/#/cybersecurity/phishing_examples)[https://it.bockwaterheaters.com/#/cybersecurity/phishing_examples]
