## Overview

Microsoft OneDrive is a cloud storage service included with the Microsoft 365 suite. 
It allows you to store, access, and share your work files securely from any device, with automatic syncing and backup across platforms.
If you have a user account with us, you get 1TB of OneDrive storage to use.

Important Note: we recommend that you use OneDrive. 
In the event that your computer stops working, OneDrive will have your Desktop, Documents, and Pictures folders backed up so you won't have to worry as much about data loss.
In addition, OneDrive will automatically restore your backed up files to your new computer upon sign-in in the event that you need to upgrade your device.
