## Overview

Microsoft Outlook is our organization's primary email and calendar platform. It is included in the Microsoft 365 suite.
Outlook allows you to send and receive email, schedule meetings, manage contacts, and access your [Microsoft 365 Groups](https://it.bockwaterheaters.com/#/services/groups).

**Important Note**: as many of you may have noticed, Microsoft has released an optional 'New Outlook' app. At this time, we recommend continuing to use the Classic Outlook app. 
The New Outlook app is still missing many of the features we use on a daily basis here. 
You may choose to use the New Outlook app, but please be warned that our ability to solve issues relating to the New Outlook app will be limited.
