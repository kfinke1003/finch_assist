# Microsoft Teams

*Last Updated: July 11, 2025*

## Overview

Microsoft Teams has become a core part of how we collaborate across the organization. It offers real-time communication, file sharing, and virtual meetings from any location.
Teams is designed to reduce the need for long email threads and to simplify file sharing to help everyone stay aligned and efficient.
This makes it an ideal candidate for collaborating on team projects, hosting virtual meetings, or just asking quick questions.

## Benefits
- **Streamlined Communication**: Chat rooms allow for quick messaging and remove the need for confusing email chains.
- **Effective Collaboration**: You can easily upload, share, and work on documents with individual people and groups.
- **Easy Scheduling**: Much like Outlook, your calendar and the company calendar can be interacted with on Teams.
- **RingCentral Integration**: One of Teams' many integrations is with [RingCentral](https://it.bockwaterheaters.com/#/services/ringcentral) â€” our current telephony platform. 

## Requirements
- A user account with us
- An up to date version of Windows

## Getting Started
- Teams gets installed as part of the [Microsoft 365](https://it.bockwaterheaters.com/#/services/m365) suite.
